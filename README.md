# Brainstorm-Custom-Processes
Repository for all custom-made Brainstorm Processes written by the author MinChul Park.

Brainstorm, an MEG/EEG analysis software within the Matlab environment allows users to generate and use their own custom-made analysis processes as a plug-in for personalised use.
Over time I wrote several custom processes for this purpose and this repository holds the processes that I have written with the help of Brainstorm software engineers, Fran√ßois Tadel and Raymundo Cassani.
To be able to use these processes one must install Matlab and then Brainstorm first.

The folder titled "Auditory Evoked Potentials" contains custom processes for analysing auditory evoked potentials (AEP). 
The processes were mainly used to analyse auditory brainstem responses (ABR; an early component of the AEP) but can be used for later potentials.
To learn more about these processes visit https://neuroimage.usc.edu/forums/t/sharing-custom-process-for-abr-analysis/40412.

The other process is for analysing sleep spindles, which are EEG hallmarks for stage 2 NREM sleep.
