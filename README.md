# Brainstorm-Custom-Processes
Repository for all custom-made Brainstorm Processes
This repository holds the custom-made processes written by the author (MinChul Park) that can be used as a plug-in for the Brainstorm software within the Matlab environment. 
Brainstorm allows users to generate and use their own custom-made analysis processes as a plug-in for personalised use. 
Therefore, to be able to use these processes one must install Matlab and then Brainstorm first.

The first process is for analysing auditory brainstem responses (ABR).
To learn more about this process visit https://neuroimage.usc.edu/forums/t/sharing-custom-process-for-abr-analysis/40412.

The second process is for analysing sleep spindles, which are EEG hallmarks for stage 2 NREM sleep.
To learn more about this process visit https://neuroimage.usc.edu/forums/t/sharing-custom-process-for-sleep-spindle-analysis-for-sleep-researchers/42347.

To learn how to write your own process function to be used within Brainstorm visit this tutorial.
